# ❗ The Problem w/ Existing Oracles

## The problem with existing oracles

Existing oracles supply a fixed, slow growing amount of data feeds. &#x20;

* Price Feeds: Only support high volume pairs. ex: USD/BTC, USD/ETH
* Predictions market: Limited sports data, very limited game-specific data (player stats, etc..)
* Arbitration: DAOs / legal issues require very subjective data.
* Remaining data: All other data is left completely abandoned by existing systems!

In short, existing oracles are great, but they are NOT flexible or dynamic enough.  There is a wide blanket of data / data feeds that is left inaccessible.
