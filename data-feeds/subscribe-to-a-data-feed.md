# âœ… Subscribe to a Data Feed

Smart Contract Developers can subscribe to DeOracle feeds to use our Solidity interfaces.  This is essentially an on-chain API for any data supported by DeOracle.  Pay for subscription calls with DEO or by staking DEO.

Data feeds can be seen and vetted on our frontend interfaces for free.  Subscriptions are only required for on-chain use. &#x20;

Subscription fees will be discounted for early access users.
