## Overview

DeOracle is a decentralized oracle network for subjective data feeds.  DeOracle brings real-world data on-chain and verifies its reliability with DeOracle REP (reputation system).

DeOracle is useful for Smart Contract / Dapp developers who are looking for wide scope data feeds not supported by mainstream oracles.  Some use cases: prediction markets, betting, lotteries, raffles, insurance protocols, etc.
