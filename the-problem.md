## The problem with existing oracles

Existing oracles supply a fixed, slow growing amount of data feeds. &#x20;

* Price Feeds: Only support high volume pairs. ex: USD/BTC, USD/ETH
* Predictions market: Limited sports data, very limited game-specific data (player stats, etc..)

In short, existing oracles are great, but they are NOT flexible or dynamic enough.
